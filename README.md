### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm lee June

<!--
I am majoring in computer science
I have completed many practical assignments so far, but I have been storing my code repositories on my laptop because I am not familiar with how to use git and GitHub.
However, I am currently learning how to use Git properly.
When this course is over, expect my profile introduction and GitHub contributions to be beautifully decorated. Looking forward to it
