### Hi there 👋 I'm lee June
I am majoring in computer science

I have completed many practical assignments so far, but I have been storing my code repositories on my laptop because I am not familiar with how to use git and GitHub.
Such as Data Structure code,Frontend,Backend,BaekJoon code

However, I am currently learning how to use Git properly.

When this course is over, expect my profile introduction and GitHub contributions to be beautifully decorated. Looking forward to it
